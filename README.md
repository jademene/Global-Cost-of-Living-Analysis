# Statistics Project | Global Costs of Living Analysis
In this analysis, the costs of living worldwide is explored. The data has been scraped from [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/) and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living/data?select=cost-of-living_v2.csv). 
The primary goal of this project is to gain familiarity with R and R Studio, and learn how to extract meaning from relatively large datasets. As such, it isn't important whether the data points are real or not.
