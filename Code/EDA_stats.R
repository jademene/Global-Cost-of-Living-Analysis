#ANALYSIS -> Outliers present in x2, x4, x15, x32, x35, x36, x39, x46, x50, x51, x52, x54
  #x2 Meal for 2 People, Mid-range -> Mendrisio, Switzerland USD 213.69 -> considering that this looks at mid-range restaurants the price can be accepted (despite it being on the higher end)
  #x4 Domestic Beer (in restaurant) -> Al Wakrah, Qatar USD 20.60 -> cost of beer tends to be higher in countries whose majority of the population is Muslim due to scarcity and high avg cost of living
  #x15 Beef Round (1kg) -> top outliers are both cities from Switzerland 
  #x32 Taxi 1hour Waiting (Normal Tariff) -> Niamay, Nigeria -> False data
  #x34, x35 New cars -> outliers are both Iranian cities, the cost of owning a car compared to the rest of the cost of living doesn't seem to match
  #x39 Fitness Club -> outliers are oultindish, not sure they can be relied on
  #x46 Fitenss shoes -> 900+USD for a pair of common running shoes seems outlandish for any country?
  #x50 Apartment (3 bedrooms) in City Centre -> Seoul + Shanghai
  #x51 Apartment (3 bedrooms) Outside of Centre -> Kermanshah,	Iran this doesn't seem correct
  #x54 Average Monthly Net Salary (After Tax) -> Schaan, Liechtenstein, the country is so small that for analysis purposes I think we can disregard this

#ACTIONS -> Trim oultiers for x15 (top 2), x32(top 1), x39 (top 2), x46 (top 2), x50 (top 2), x51 (top 1)

#Other considerations
  #in original analysis Solomon islands outlier in internet -> false data. I wonder if any of the utilities data is reliable.
  #Niamey, Niger -> the categorical data seems incorrect, we might need to manually fact check this row -> incorrect values x32, x34, x37, x38
  #Countries such as Greenland might simply lack the information for certain values (eg cars) so results should be taking this factors into consideration.
